PyGaap is the Python port of JGAAP, Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program by Patrick Juola

This is a map of widgets and function calls, mostly for the devs to look at.
**Please use monospaced typefaces/fonts with no word wrap to display this file.
In the GUI code, set debug to 3 to see function calls.

(Rough outline of names for the main GUI frames.)

name                                         description (Tkinter module used)

topwindow                                    name of main window (Tk)
|-menubar                                    name of top menu bar (Menu)
|-workspace                                  main Frame under topwindow that contains notebook Tabs (Frame)
| |-tabs                                     This sets up the tabs (Notebook)
| | |-Tab_Documents                          Holds widgets in Documents tab (Frame)
| | | |-Tab_Documents_UnknownAuthors_Frame   Contains Listbox for unknown authors (Frame)
| | | |-Tab_Documents_doc_buttons            Buttons for unknown authors (Frame)
| | | |-Tab_Documents_KnownAuthors_Frame     Contains Listbox for unknown authors (Frame)
| | | |-Tab_Documents_knownauth_buttons      Buttons for known authors (Frame)
| | |
| | |    The 4 tabs below are generated by create_feature_tab(). The widgets in these tabs are saved in "objects".
| | |-Tab_Canonicizers                       Holds widgets in Canonicizers tab (Frame)           widgets in objects["Tab_Canonicizers"]
| | |-Tab_EventDrivers                       Holds widgets in Event Drivers tab (Frame)          widgets in objects["Tab_EventDrivers"]
| | |-Tab_EventCulling                       Same Setup as Event Drivers Tab                     widgets in objects["Tab_EventCulling"]
| | |-Tab_AnalysisMethods                    Holds widgets in Analysis Methods tab (Frame)       widgets in objects["Tab_AnalysisMethods"]
| | |
| | |    within the dictionary entry listed above as %%%, the structure is as follows:
| | |-%%%
| | | |-["top_frame"]
| | | | |-["available_frame"]                Contains the listboxes where available features are displayed.
| | | | |-["buttons_frame"]                  Contains the add/remove/clear buttons.
| | | | |-["selected_frame"]                 Contains the listbox where selected features are displayed.
| | | | |-["parameters_frame"]               Contains the frame where parameters of a feature are displayed. # Tab_EventDrivers and Tab_AnalysisMethods only.
| | | |
| | | |-["description_frame"]                Contains the text box where the description of a feature is displayed.
| | |
| | |-Tab_ReviewProcess                      Holds widgets in Review & Process tab (Frame)
| | | |-Tab_ReviewProcess_Canonicizers       Contains corresponding listbox
| | | |-Tab_ReviewProcess_EventDrivers

| | |
|-bottomframe                                Hold buttons at the bottom: Notes, Next, and Finish.
|-status_bar                                 Contains the label (text) for status.
